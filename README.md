# The Towers

The Towers is a simple PvP game mode for Minecraft.

> [!WARNING]  
> This plugin is currently under development and is not yet ready to be configured or used on external servers!

Players are divided into several teams. Each team has its own **Tower** with a **Heart** inside. The objective is to defend your team's Heart while trying to destroy the Hearts of other teams.

To enhance gameplay, the plugin includes an equipment progression system that allows players to upgrade their armor, weapons, and tools by gathering various resources such as iron, diamonds and more.

Additionally, special events occur at regular intervals, dropping supply crates in the center of the map. These crates contain a variety of powerful and useful items.

The plugin was designed to be played with a bunch of friends, but Iâ€™m working to make sure it performs just as well in the more demanding environment of public servers.
